# Intel-Project-Solution
This is my attempt for problem of detecting pixelation in the images and correcting them in this solution i have used a concept of laplacian varinace with a threshold for comparison i tried to get a pretrained model as well for this but my system does not support cuda also i have experimented with various filters and applied them prudently for the correction part that is jpeg restoration i searched a alot and used filter and pixel variance and laplacian vairance to correct the image although the output is not perfect but it is  a pretty good image
